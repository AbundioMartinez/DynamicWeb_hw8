XML is a markup language much like HTML.3. What object does AJAX use to request data from the server? AJAX uses a built-in browser XMLHttpRequest object to request data from the server.4. What is the special feature of AJAX that makes developers like to work with it? Hint: It has to do with enhancing the User Experience (UX). AJAX allows the web page to make changes asynchronously, meaning it can update parts of the website without reloading the whole page. This is possible because AJAX exchanges data with the server behind the scenes. This better User Experience (UX). 5. Explain the basic five steps involved in the execution of an AJAX XMLHttpRequest() between the browser and the server. 1. An event can occur on the web page when the page is loaded or when a button is clicked. 2. An XMLHttpRequest() object sends a request to the server. 3. The server sends back a response to the web page that made the request. 4. The response is read by JavaScript. 5. JavaScript executes the page update. 6. What makes up the core of AJAX? The XMLHttpRequest() object makes the core of AJAX. 7. What is the XMLHttpRequest() Object used for? The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a web server asynchronously.   8. What is the syntax for XMLHttpRequest()? Syntax: variable = new XMLhttpRequest(); 9. Give me an example of XMLHttpRequest(). Use your project code please. code example from my project: const xhttps = new XMLHttpRequest(); 10. What must be called before any other method calls and why?  XMLHttpRequest() constructor initializes an XMLHttpRequest() object. It  must be called before other method calls.11. In the OMDB API project, even though the OMDB API is served over http, we use https. Why?-Live servers do not use http. Having https is a live server and is secured.12. What keyword is used to initialize the XMLHttpRequest() object? keyword is new. 13. What does new XMLHttpRequest() create? -To create an instance of the ArchiveTemp.ArchiveTemp() constructor function.14. What are the 5 things that the new keyword does? 1. It creates an object from constructor function like XMLHttpRequest(). 2. It sets the new object's internal, inaccessible/ private, a property of prototype to constructor function's external; accessible, prototype object. Every object has a prototype property. 3. It executes the constructor function, using the newly created object whenever this is mentioned. 4. The new keyword makes this keyword point to the newly created object. The constructor function refers to the function that follows the new keyword. 5. It returns this if the function does not return its own object. 15. Using code from your project, give me an example of this being returned due to the use of the new keyword with XMLHttpRequest() to create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest() Object. this code example: xhttps.onreadystatechange = function () {         if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) {             console.log(this.responseText);            console.log(JSON.parse(this.responseText));            const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);            document.getElementById("movie-title").innerHTML = data.Title;            document.getElementById("poster").src = data.Poster;            document.getElementById("director").innerHTML = data.Director;            document.getElementById("writer").innerHTML = data.Writer;             document.getElementById("genre").innerHTML = data.Genre;            document.getElementById("plot").innerHTML = data.Plot;        }   16. Describe what the XMLHttpRequest.open() method does. XMLHttpRequest.open() initializes a newly-created request or re-initializes an existing one.  17. Using code from your project, give me an example of XMLHttpRequest.open(). XMLHttpRequest.open() code example from my project: xhttps.open("GET", url, true); 18. Tell me what the values passed to the XMLHttpRequest.open() method are for, and give me the parameters they represent the values (aka arguments) of. Hint: part of the answer may reside in the slide deck and inside the Related Resources links at the end of the deck, and part will reside in the README.md of the week 8 homework repository. You will have come across the information while reading the instructions for going through the steps of building your project. -GET is the method (the value of the first parameter passed to open()) we are using. We are requesting to "GET" data from the OMDB Api.-url is the url we are sending our request.-true, we are making the request asynchronously.19. Using code from your project, give me an example of XMLHttpRequest.send(). code example from my project using XMLHttpRequest.send(): xhttps.send(); 20. Tell me if there are any values passed to our XMLHttpRequest.send() method. What optionally could be passed to the method, and why do we NOT have to pass this optional parameter/argument to our XMLHttpRequest.send() method? 1-Set the send() method on our xhttps object/variable.2-send() immediately follows the call to open(), and is placed right below xhttps.send().3-Nothing is passed in to it.
